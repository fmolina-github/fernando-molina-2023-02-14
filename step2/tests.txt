1. define function checkRequiredAndOptional
    if 'lat' or 'lon' is present
        go to validateAndCreateExpectedResponse case1
    if 'zip' is present
        go to validateAndCreateExpectedResponse case2
    if 'city' or 'state' or 'country' is present
        go to validateAndCreateExpectedResponse case3

2. define function validateAndCreateExpectedResponse case 1
    if 'lat' and 'lon' are present
        return success expected response
    else
        return error expected response

3. define function validateAndCreateExpectedResponse case 2
    if 'zip' are present
        return success expected response

4. define function validateAndCreateExpectedResponse case 3
    if 'city' or ('city' and ('state' or 'country')) are present
        return success expected response
    else
        return error expected response

5. define function checkResponse
    if expected response success
        check for 200 or 201 status response
        check for success messages
        if response body is present
            validate data
    else if expected repsonse error
        check for 400, 401, 404 status response
        check for error message

6. set api host
7. set api request
8. add api parameters
9. call checkRequiredAndOptional function
    set expected response
10. do api call
11. call checkResponse function
